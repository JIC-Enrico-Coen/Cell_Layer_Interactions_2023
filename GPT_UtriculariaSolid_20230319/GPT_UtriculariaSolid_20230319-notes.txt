A model of a stem consisting of a solid cylinder. It is divided into three regions, labelled with morphogens ID_AXIS, ID_BLADES, and ID_EPIDERMIS. These correspond to the similarly-named regions of the GPT_Utricularia_20230319 model. Where that model had six "blades" linking the core to the epidermis, this model has solid tissue filling the whole space.

All growth is along the polariser gradient only, which is initially set up to be vertical.
There is no strain retention. At the start, the mesh is given a small random perturbation
to the positions of all the vertexes, to break the symmetry and allow buckling (although
this model in fact is not prone to buckling).

The options for this model (set near the end of the interaction function) are the same as for GPT_Utricularia_20230319.
