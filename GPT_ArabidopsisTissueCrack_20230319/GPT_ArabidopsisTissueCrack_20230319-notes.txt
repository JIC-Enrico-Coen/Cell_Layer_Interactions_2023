A model of a solid stem with vertical growth in the core region and zero growth
in the outer skin. Cracks form when the residual tension exceeds some level.

The direction of the cracks is heavily biased by the structure of the mesh,
because the implementation of cracks only allows them to form along the boundaries of
the finite elements. A more ideal model would be able to split the elements themselves
along whatever the plane of greatest tension was.

All specified growth is parallel to the polariser only. The polariser is initially
set up to have a vertical gradient, and thereafter remains fixed in the tissue and moves with it.

These are the purposes of the options:

Radius of the core as a fraction of the outer radius. The arithmetical expression
used here is chosen because the mesh for this model has 6 concentric cylinders of
elements (narrower towards the outside: the two outer layers together have a thickness
of 1/6). By setting the core radius to a hair under 5/6, we ensure that the outer layer
will consist of exactly the outermost cylinder.
            'coreradius', [], 5/6 - 0.0004, ...

Growth rate of the inner part of the cylinder:
            'innergrowthrate', [], 0.04, ...

Growth rate of the outer layer of the cylinder:
            'outergrowthrate', [], 0, ...

Along which axes should the outermost vertexes be fixed in space? Any
subset of the string 'xyz'. Only 'z', 'xyz', or the empty string are useful.
            'fixoutervertexes', { 'z', 'xyz', '' }, '', ...

Bulk modulus of the outer layer. The bulk modulus of the inner core is always 1.
            'outerbulkmodulus', {}, 1, ...

Whether cracks should happen as a result of tension.
            'crackbytension', {}, true, ...

'crackheight', 'crackradius', 'crackstartangle', and 'crackendangle' are
only used for testing purposes. A single crack is initially made at the
location specified by these values.
            'crackheight', {}, 0, ...
            'crackradius', {}, 2.5*4/6-0.0001, ...
            'crackstartangle', {}, -2*pi/3 - 0.0001, ...
            'crackendangle', {}, -pi/3 + 0.0001, ...

'makeinitcracks' determines whether any cracks should be artificially made at the start.
Mainly for testing purposes.
            'makeinitcracks', {}, false, ...

'weakness' and 'diffusiontime' determine the distribution of the S_WEAKNESS
morphogen. S_WEAKNESS sets the strength of the tissue: the higher the value, the lower the
tension at which it will crack. S_WEAKNESS is always in the range from 0 to 'weakness'.
Initially it is given an independent random value at every vertex. The distribution is then
smoother by being allowed to diffuse for the time specified by 'diffusiontime'. After each
diffusion step it is rescaled to the interval from zero to 'weakness'. After that time,
its diffusivity is set to zero to freeze the pattern, and growth starts.
            'weakness', [], 0.4, ...
            'diffusiontime', [], 2, ...

'breakingstress' is the residual stress required to make or extend a crack.
The only difference between stress and strain is that the stress is the strain
times the bulk modulus. By default the bulk modulus is 1 everywhere, in which
case there is no difference. The 'outerbulkmodulus' option allows for making
the outer layer stiffer or less stiff than the inner core.
            'breakingstress', {}, 0.033, ...

'strainretention' sets the rate at which retained strain is retained,
i.e. 0 = instant dissipation, 1 = no dissipation. 0.5 = decay by a factor of
exp(-0.5) in one time unit.
            'strainretention', {}, 0.5 ...
