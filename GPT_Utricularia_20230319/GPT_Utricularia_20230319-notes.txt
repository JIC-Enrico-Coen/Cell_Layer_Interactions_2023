A model of a stem consisting of an inner shaft connected to an outer skin by six equally
spaced vertical membranes (the 'blades').

The different regions are labelled with morphogens ID_AXIS, ID_BLADES, and ID_EPIDERMIS.

All growth is along the polariser gradient only, which is initially set up to be vertical.
There is no strain retention. At the start, the mesh is given a small random perturbation
to the positions of all the vertexes, to break the symmetry and allow buckling.

The clipping parameters are set so that turning on clipping shows a horizontal slice.

Clipping by morphogen hides the outer cylinder.


Options:

The growth rate, where there is growth.
            'growthrate', [], 0.04, ...

The growing region. 'cyl' means the central cylinder. 'cylblades' means the central cylinder
and the blades. 'all' means everywhere.
            'growthregion', { 'cyl', 'cylblades', 'all' }, 'cylblades', ...

Growth is set to zero within a certain distance of the top and bottom of the stem.
            'endmargin', [], 1, ... % No growth within this distance of the initial top or bottom.

'fixoutervertexes' and 'fixendvertexes' specify which axes to fix the vertexes of the
outer cylinder or the vertexes of the top and bottom surfaces. 'z' fixes them vertically,
'xyz' fixes them in all directions, and the empty string means not to fix them at all.
            'fixoutervertexes', { 'z', 'xyz', '' }, '', ...
            'fixendvertexes', { 'z', 'xyz', '' }, '' ...
