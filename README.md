This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Genetic control of cell layer interactions in plants via tissue mechanics", by Kelly-Bellow et al., to appear in Science, probably in 2023.

There are four models:

GPT\_ArabidopsisTissueCrack\_20230319  GPT\_Utricularia\_20230319  GPT\_UtriculariaSolid\_20230319  GPT\_UtriculariaThirdBladesMissing\_20230319

They can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
